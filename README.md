## Functionality Of Scheduler

>* When the planner is opened, the current day and time is displayed at the top of the calendar
>* When you scroll down, the user is presented with time blocks for standard business hours (from 8AM to 5PM)
>* When the user views the time blocks for that day, each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
  * ![#d3d3d3](https://via.placeholder.com/15/d3d3d3/000000?text=+) `Past` 
  * ![#ff6961](https://via.placeholder.com/15/dd6961/000000?text=+) `Present`
  * ![#77dd77](https://via.placeholder.com/15/77dd77/000000?text=+) `Future` 
>* Then the user can click into a time block and enter an event
>* When clicked on the save button on the right for that time block, then the text for that event is saved in local storage
>* When the page is refreshed, the saved events persist
