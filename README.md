## Functionality Of Scheduler

>* When the planner is opened, the current day and time is displayed at the top of the calendar
>* When you scroll down, the user is presented with time blocks for standard business hours (from 8AM to 5PM)
>* When the user views the time blocks for that day, each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past (gray), present (red), or future (green)
>* Then the user can click into a time block and enter an event
>* When clicked on the save button on the right for that time block, then the text for that event is saved in local storage
>* When the page is refreshed, the saved events show
